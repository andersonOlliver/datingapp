# DatingApp

This repository contains two applications:

- Dotnet Core API
- Angular 

The purpose is to provide a basic example of integration between these two technologies 

## Commands to start

### Dotnet Core

(Just to remember you need to have the [Net SDK](https://www.microsoft.com/net) previously installed)

After clone this repo, open a terminal in the directory _**DatingApp.API**_ and run 
- **dotnet restore**
-  **dotnet watch run**

The first command will install the required dependencies for the application and 
the second will start a server instance listening on port 5000



### Angular

(Again to remember you need to have the [Angular CLI](https://cli.angular.io/) previously installed)

Open a terminal in the directory _**DatingApp.SPA**_ and run

- **npm install**
- **ng serve --open**


The first command will install the required dependencies for the application and
the second will start a node server instance listening on port 4200
